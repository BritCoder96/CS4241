    <h1>Information about Bryan Benson (Class of 2018)</h1>
    <p>
      I am an avid software developer. Outside of computer science, I enjoy soccer (my father is from North London, and I support a team from there). I also love board and card games, and am an avid Magic: The Gathering player. I have significant experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby, as I have build and worked on several applications in Ruby on Rails (my jobs at CipherHealth, Medidata, and Study Clash all involved webapps in Rails). I also have quite a bit of experience with Java, for several classes such as Software Engineering and CS 4223. I also have some experience with Python, as I wrote a 2D platformer in Python (the source code is on my Github). I also have quite a bit of experience with unit testing, as most of my projects and work experience has required it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major: Computer Science, with a minor in Bioinfomatics and Computational Biology.
